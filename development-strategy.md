## 3. User Story: Save button for biggest and smallest number user inputs.

> * As a user I would like to have an application to remember and **save** the biggest and smallest number I input.
> * Changing in `handlers` and `listeners`, `save-number.js` file.
> * In `handlers` I was defining new value by using a method to find biggest and smallest, it gives away new value to remember. In `listener` was applied `handler` **function** to be saved on **click**.

## 4. User Story: Reset button.

> * As a user I would like to have a **reset button** if I want to erase what was saved before.
> * Changing in `handlers` and `listeners`, `reset.js`
> * In `handlers` I was defining reset value, setting everything to it's original to give out ones reset. In `listeners` was applied `handler` **function** to reset all on **click**.
